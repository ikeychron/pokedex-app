# Pokedex App ðŸš€

This app is a test project made for Fabiana (LinkedIn Recruiter). It features four pages: a login page with validation, a main page with a grid of 10 Pokemon cards and pagination, a details page for the selected Pokemon, and a profile page where you can view the name and email of the logged-in user. It is built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Context, Custom Hooks, Atomic Design, and it fetches data from the Pokedex API. The app also includes end-to-end tests using Cypress.

## Getting Started

To run the app, follow these simple steps:

1. Install dependencies by running `npm install` in your terminal.
2. Create a `.env` file and write your port number as `PORT=3000` for when you start the server.
3. Start the development server by running `npm run dev` for development mode or `npm start` for production mode. Note that the production mode has a script that allows you to modify the server's PORT through the `.env` file.
4. If you want to run the tests, use `npm run cy:run` or `npm run cy:open`. The tests should run simultaneously with the Next.js development server.
